# C# .NET Unit Testing Basics

This repository is designed to help developers build a strong foundation in unit testing with C#, focusing on tools like xUnit, StyleCop, and SonarQube. It includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, and best practices to improve code quality and reliability.

## How to Run Tests for Each Session

1. Navigate to the session folder:
   ```bash
        cd Session1/practice
   ```
Build the projects:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

Run the tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
   ```

After running the tests, you can find the coverage report in:
   ```plaintext
   Tests/TestResults/<unique-id>/coverage.cobertura.xml
   ```
To visualize the coverage, consider using tools like **Coverage Gutters** in VS Code or uploading the XML to [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io).
